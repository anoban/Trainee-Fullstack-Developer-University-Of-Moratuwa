## Frontend Tasks

In this task section, you are required to implement a searching functionality for the `teacher` and `student` classes.

In the `teacher-table` component's `component.ts` file, you will find an empty `search` method. You should implement the logic for searching inside this function. Do the same in the `student-table` component as well.

Task: Search a `teacher` or a `student` by his/her `name`.

Input: Any searching text > `String`.

Output: Update the `teacherData` array of the `teacher` class, and do the same for the `student` class.

> **Important**: Don't change the name of the `search` function. Differing names will cause to lose marks.
