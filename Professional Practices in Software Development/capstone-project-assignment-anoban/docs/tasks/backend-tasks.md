## Backend Tasks

Our first task is to implement the `Database Interaction Functions` for the `student` class.

> Refer to [this](/docs/chapters/implementing-the-backend.md#21-creating-the-functions-to-interact-with-the-database) section in the teacher class for further details.

Tasks to complete:
1. Update the `readStudents` function to read all student data.
2. Update the `readStudentInfo` function to read the information of a specified student.
3. Update the `addStudent` function to add a student.
4. Update the `updateStudent` function to update details of a specific student.
5. Update the `deleteStudent` function to delete a specified student.

> **Important**: Don't do any changes for the `function names` given in the template when implementing the `student's` database functions. Differing names will cause to lose marks.
