        <ul style="list-style:disc">
            <li>Whales are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic placental marine mammals. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla, which consists of even-toed ungulates.</li><br><br>
            <li>Their closest non-cetacean living relatives are the hippopotamuses, from which they and other cetaceans diverged about 54 million years ago.<br><br> 
            <li>The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti), are thought to have had their last common ancestor around 34 million years ago.<br><br> 
            <li>Whales consist of eight extant families: Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), Eschrichtiidae (the grey whale), Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale), and Ziphiidae (the beaked whales).<br><br>

            <li>Whales are fully aquatic, open-ocean creatures: they can feed, mate, give birth, suckle and raise their young at sea.</li><br><br> 
            <li>Whales range in size from the 2.6 metres (8.5 ft) and 135 kilograms (298 lb) dwarf sperm whale to the 29.9 metres (98 ft) and 190 metric tons (210 short tons) blue whale, which is the largest known creature that has ever lived.</li><br><br>
            <li>The sperm whale is the largest toothed predator on earth. Several whale species exhibit sexual dimorphism, in that the females are larger than males.</li><br><br>

            <li>Baleen whales have no teeth; instead they have plates of baleen, fringe-like structures that enable them to expel the huge mouthfuls of water they take in, while retaining the krill and plankton they feed on. Because their heads are enormous—making up as much as 40% of their total body mass—and they have throat pleats that enable then to expand their mouths, they are able to take huge quantities of water into their mouth at a time. Baleen whales also have a well developed sense of smell.</li><br><br>

            <li>Toothed whales, in contrast, have conical teeth adapted to catching fish or squid. They also have such keen hearing—whether above or below the surface of the water—that some can survive even if they are blind. Some species, such as sperm whales, are particularly well adapted for diving to great depths to catch squid and other favoured prey.</li><br><br>

            <li>Whales evolved from land-living mammals, and must regularly surface to breathe air, although they can remain under water for long periods of time. Some species, such as the sperm whale can stay underwater for up to 90 minutes. They have blowholes (modified nostrils) located on top of their heads, through which air is taken in and expelled.</li><br><br>
            <li>They are warm-blooded, and have a layer of fat, or blubber, under the skin. With streamlined fusiform bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers, whales can travel at speeds of up to 20 knots, though they are not as flexible or agile as seals.</li><br><br>
            <li>Whales produce a great variety of vocalizations, notably the extended songs of the humpback whale.</li><br><br>
            <li>Although whales are widespread, most species prefer the colder waters of the northern and southern hemispheres, and migrate to the equator to give birth. Species such as humpbacks and blue whales are capable of travelling thousands of miles without feeding. Males typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate every two to three years. Calves are typically born in the spring and summer; females bear all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers in some species fast and nurse their young for one to two years.</li><br><br>

            <dt>Commercial whaling</dt><br>
            <dd> Commercial hunting has reduced populations of most, if not all the large whales to critical levels. Only the small minke whale (six to seven metres long and weighing five to seven tonnes) is still relatively abundant. Without sufficient information on populations, continued harvesting could cause the extinction of some species.<br>
            Of an estimated quarter of a million blue whales, less than 2,000 are estimated to remain. Fin whales are less than five percent and humpback and sei whales 10 to 20 percent of their previous abundance. Of an estimated 60,000 southern right whales, only a few thousand remain.</dd><br><br>
            <dt>Pollution</dt><br>
            <dd>Exposure to chronic pollutants can have a devastating impact on the health and fertility of marine mammals. In particular, concern is now focused on organochlorines, such as PCBs, once widely used in industry. An estimated 65% of the total volume of PCBs ever produced world-wide are still in use, in storage, or have been deposited into landfills. Currently some 20% have made their way into oceans. These pollutants concentrate in fatty tissue such as blubber and milk. Females transfer them in large quantities to their young when suckling.<br>
            The World Health Organisation standard classifies any material with a PCB level of 50 parts per million (ppm) as highly toxic waste. Levels of organochlorines found in marine mammals in some parts of the world far exceed this level.</dd><br><br>
            <dt>Toxic algal blooms</dt><br>
            <dd>
            While these occur naturally they are also thought to be stimulated by factors such as pollution, population growth, changing weather patterns and dredging of the ocean floor. Many `red tide' algae produce phyto-toxins, which can be amongst the most potent natural poisons in the world. Red tides have caused mass mortality of whales and dolphins in the USA and Europe.</dd><br><br>
            <dt>Ozone depletion</dt><br>
            <dd>Since the discovery of the ozone hole over Antarctica, concern has been raised over the effect of increased UV-B radiation. Even small increases could result in major changes to the marine ecosystem.</dd><br><br>
            <dt>Global warming</dt><br>
            <dd>Global warming could affect marine mamals by impacting on the food chain and therefore their food supply.</dd><br><br>
            <dt>Whale watching</dt><br>
            <dd>Whale watching is an expanding tourist industry grossing over $700 million world-wide. Whale watching provides opportunities for education and furthering scientific knowledge. However, the rapid growth of the industry is raising concerns over possible impacts on the behaviour, migration and breeding of whales. The number of whale watching vessels around whales may disturb their normal activity. Physical harm can also be inflicted by collisions and cuts from propellers.</dd><br><br>

        <h2> Should we be concerned? </h2>
        <img src="humpback_whale-wallpaper-1920x1200.jpg" width="100%">
        <dl style="list-style:disc; font-size:22px; color:white; width:95%; margin-left:10px;"> 
        <dt> Decline of whales in oceans mean a decline in the services provided by them to humans as well as the entire global marine ecosystem! </dt><br><br>
        <dt>Enhancing Productivity</dt><br>
            <dd>Far from just providing huge amounts of meat, blubber, and oil for human consumption, whales provide important ecosystem services that have gone overlooked in debates about commercial whaling and whale conservation.<br><br>
            Whale fecal plumes contain valuable nutrients like iron, nitrogen, and phosphorus. They stimulate production of microscopic marine algae, or phytoplankton, which form the base of many marine food chains. Phytoplankton, via photosynthesis, convert chlorophyll, sunlight, and a variety of nutrients including carbon dioxide into energy, while expelling oxygen. Phytoplankton feed zooplankton, tiny animals that live in surface waters, and both are critical food sources for many marine species such as krill and other marine invertebrates, fish, and even marine mammals, including whales.<br><br>
            In a study of blue whales in Antarctica, scientists determined that iron concentration in blue whale feces is 10 million times that of Antarctic seawater. As iron is a limiting micronutrient in the Southern Ocean, its availability triggers phytoplankton blooms. Another study determined that blue whales in the Southern Ocean, via fecal plumes, increase primary production available to support fisheries by 240,000 (metric) tonnes of organic carbon (which all animals in the oceans need to survive) per year. If blue whales recover to pre-industrial whaling levels, this benefit will increase to 11 million tonnes of carbon per year—increasing, not decreasing, fishery yields. While this is only a small fraction of the overall primary production in the Southern Ocean, at the local scale where such fertilization benefits are realized, the impacts may be significant.<br><br>
            Indeed, scientists have determined that the slaughter of baleen whales in the Southern Ocean caused a long-term decline in primary production, which, in turn, caused the krill population to plummet to as low as 20 percent of pre-industrial whaling levels. Today, although whale stocks in the Southern Ocean are recovering—some more quickly than others—krill numbers have not recovered to pre-industrial whaling levels and are now threatened by direct harvest and climate change.<br><br>
            In the Gulf of Maine, scientists found that marine mammals enhance primary production in feeding areas by supplying nitrogen to surface waters through release of fecal plumes and urine. They determined that whales and seals may replenish 23,000 tonnes of nitrogen per year in the Gulf of Maine surface waters, more than the input of nitrogen from all of the rivers feeding the gulf combined.<br><br>
            In another study, endangered right whales in the Bay of Fundy in Canada were found to enhance primary productivity through the release of nitrogen and phosphorus in their fecal plumes. In Hawaii, the feeding behavior of 80 sperm whales transferred 100 tonnes of nitrogen from deep waters to surface waters, enhancing primary production by 600 tonnes of organic carbon per year. Due to the decimation of sperm whales by commercial whaling, however, Hawaiian waters have lost 2,000 tonnes of new nitrogen each year, decreasing primary production in the region by 1,000 tonnes of organic carbon annually.<br><br>
            The deep diving and surfacing behavior of sperm whales and some baleen whales transports nutrients in their fecal plumes from deeper water to the surface and, for gray and humpback whales, by carrying sediment from the sea floor and redistributing it in the water column, to the benefit of sea birds and other marine species. As noted by Drs. Joe Roman and James McCarthy, “Cetaceans feeding deep in the water column effectively create an upward pump, enhancing nutrient availability for primary production in locations where whales gather to feed.” This vertical transport of nutrients is referred to as the “whale pump” and was first postulated in 1983. Scientists have determined that biomixing by marine vertebrates, including whales, contributes one-third of total ocean mixing, comparable to the effect of tides or winds.<br><br>
            Whales also transport nutrients in their fecal plumes, urine, sloughed skin, and placental materials horizontally, a phenomenon referred to as the “whale conveyor belt,” as they migrate between nutrient-rich feeding areas and nutrient-limited breeding/birthing areas. Blue whales in the Southern Ocean, for example, transport approximately 88 tonnes of nitrogen per year from their feeding to their calving grounds. Before commercial whaling, blue whales would have transported 24,000 tonnes of nitrogen via the conveyor belt.<br><br>
            <dt>Sequestering Carbon</dt><br>
            <dd>Phytoplankton use carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. Thus, enhancing phytoplankton productivity via the release of nutrients in whale feces increases the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In the Southern Ocean, approximately 12,000 sperm whales deposit an estimated 36 tonnes of iron into surface waters each year, enhancing primary production in phytoplankton. While the carbon contained in some phytoplankton will continue to be recycled by marine animals feeding and defecating in surface waters, 20 to 40 percent of such carbon will settle to the sea floor as phytoplankton die and sink, effectively locking up the carbon for centuries to millennia. Globally, more than 200,000 tonnes of carbon may be sequestered—and its negative effects on climate removed—each year.<br><br>
            Sperm whales, by enhancing primary productivity, effectively remove 240,000 tonnes more carbon from the atmosphere than they add during respiration. Since sperm whale population numbers in the Southern Ocean have not recovered to pre-industrial whaling levels, an extra 2 million tonnes of carbon that could have been removed by a full complement of sperm whales remains in the atmosphere each year. Since Southern Ocean sperm whales represent only 3 percent of all sperm whales globally, the species may significantly contribute to iron fertilization and carbon drawdown.<br><br>
            When whales die, their massive bodies contain a large amount of carbon. As their carcasses sink to the ocean floor—often referred to as “whale fall,” this carbon is effectively stored in the ocean for centuries. Scientists have estimated that the combined global populations of nine great whale species (blue, fin, gray, humpback, bowhead, sei, Bryde’s, minke, and right whales) sequester nearly 29,000 tonnes of carbon per year via whale falls. Due to the significant loss of whales to commercial whaling, current populations of large baleen whales store 9.1 million tonnes less carbon than if their numbers were at pre-exploitation levels. If these whale stocks were rebuilt, they would remove 160,000 tonnes of carbon each year through whale falls, which is roughly equivalent to 110,000 hectares of forest (or an area the size of Rocky Mountain National Park).<br><br>
            <dt>Nourishing the Depths</dt><br>
            <dd>In addition to storing carbon, whale carcasses feed an array of marine and terrestrial species. When whales strand on land, bears, other mammals, scavenging birds, and marine and terrestrial invertebrates benefit from the massive windfall of food and nutrients and, in turn, expand the nutrient flow from the sea to land.<br><br>
            Whale falls, according to the scientific literature, create habitat islands, benefiting scavengers like sharks and hagfish, crustaceans, gastropods, bivalves, clams, shrimp, anemones, bacteria, and a litany of other marine organisms, including some species heretofore unknown. Indeed, scientists have identified 129 new species collected from whale remains, including over 100 considered to be whale-fall specialists, and predict that hundreds of other whale-fall specialist species remain to be discovered.<br><br>
            The frequency of whale falls declined substantially due to industrial whaling and may have caused a substantial number of anthropogenic species extinctions in the deep sea. Whether such species would have had any value to humans will never be known—although, in an interesting twist, enzymes of psychrotrophic bacteria (bacteria adapted to extremely cold environments) found at whale falls have garnered commercial interest from the laundry detergent, pharmaceutical, and food processing industries.<br><br>

            <dt>Creating Value</dt><br>
            <dd>Whales have an enormous economic value as the popular subject of marine tourism. Globally, whale watching generated over 2 billion dollars in revenue in 2012 and supported some 13,000 jobs while providing millions of people an opportunity to observe and learn about whales and other marine species in the wild. Such revenue is well in excess of the value of whale meat, blubber, or other products sold commercially, demonstrating the obvious fact that a live whale is worth far more than a dead one.<br><br>
            The ecosystem services provided by whales, including increasing primary production, directly and indirectly sequestering carbon, and providing nutrients and habitat to myriad marine species, also have an economic value. Such values have been calculated for other species, including bats and pollinators. While economists have calculated the value of whale watching, no comprehensive assessment has been done of the direct and indirect value of whales and the economic and ecosystem services they provide.</dd></dl><br><br>

            <dt>Contact the International Whaling Commission</dt><br>
            <dd>Write a letter to your country's representative on the International Whaling Commission (IWC). Visit the Humane Society International website. Then click the link to tell your IWC representative that you care about the fate of the world's whales.<br>
            Tell your IWC representative that you want the commission to close loopholes that allow Japan, Iceland, and Norway to continue killing whales</dd><br><br>
            <dt>Speak out against seismic and sonar testing</dt><br>
            <dd>Sonar and seismic testing threaten whale populations in coastal areas. Much of this testing is done by oil and gas companies or by federal agencies, like the United States Navy. Urge your government to stop sonar and seismic testing.<br>
            Try writing a letter to the National Marine Fisheries Service and urge them to protect whales from seismic and sonar testing</dd><br><br>
            <dt> Sign a petition to stop whaling</dt><br>
            <dd>One way to take direct action is by signing a petition to stop whaling in countries like Japan, Iceland, or Norway. You can add your name to a growing list of global citizens who oppose the continuation of whaling practices.<br>
            You can find global and local petitions on websites like change.org</dd><br><br>
            <dt>Boycott products that contain whale meat</dt><br>
            <dd>Japan is free to ignore the statutes of the International Whaling Commission, and thereby sets its own quotas and standards for whaling. Meat from Japan's so-called "research whaling" is then packaged and sold on international markets. Avoid consuming whale meat or buying products made from whales</dd><br><br>
            <dt>Support efforts to curb climate change</dt><br>
            <dd>Warming oceans and diminishing sea ice are affecting whale habitats around the globe. Contact your government representatives and tell them to support international, national, and local efforts to curb carbon emissions and fight global warming</dd><br><br>
