Content model defines what set of contents each element is allowed to have.
This means that such models define what other elements are allowed to be nested inside the defined elements.

Every HTML element has a default dispaly value depending on what type of element it is.
There are two display values: inline level & block level
Modern HTML splits these two into seven models
An HTML body part may contain several code blocks.
These blocks can contain many inline elements.
 
Block elements are large building blocks of a web page!
Web browsers automatically add a line break at the end of block elements

Inline elements are used to mark parts of block elements.
Brwsers do not automatically add line breaks at the end of inline elemens.
Block elements begin in a new line while inline elements do not!.

Modern HTML has 7 content models:
Metadata content
Sectioning content
Flow content
Heading content
Phrasing content
Embedded content
Interactive content

Metadata content defines the behaviour of all other contents
e.g. base, command, style, link, noscript, title tags!

Flow contents are elements that are included in the normal flow of the document.
e.g. img, header, footer, table, form, label, input, button, h1, h2, h3, ... etc...

Sectioning content define the scope of headers and footers.
e.g. article, aisde, nav, section tags

Heading contents define the headers of a document.
e.g. h1, h2, h3, h4, ... hgroup.. etc...

Phrasing content is the text content of a document and the elements used to markup text within paragraph level containers.
e.g. b, i, strong, small, big, etc

Embedded contents are the elements that import external resources into the document.
e.g. img, audio, embed, video, object... etc

Interactive content are the elements specifically intended for user interaction.

These content models are not at all exclusive. Most elements that belong to one content model will fall under many other content models!.
