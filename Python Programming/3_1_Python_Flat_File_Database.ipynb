    "Databases are organised collections of ***data***, this allows them to be displayed, maintained and searched easily. Our database will have 1 ***table***, effectively just like a spreadsheet table. The headings on each of the columns are the ***fields***, the individual pieces of data we want to store about the books in our collection. The information about a single book are called its ***attributes*** and are stored toegther in one ***record***, which would be a single row in our database table. To make it easier to search and sort our database, we should also select a ***primary key***, one field that will be unique for each book. Sometimes one of the fields we are already storing works for this purpose, if not then the database will create an ID number that it uses to uniquely identify each record."

    "To store the new records,  we check if there is something in the new_additions list, this is for later when it will be possible to run your program without adding a book. We then open the csv file, by calling the open function with the filename variable we set up a moment ago. The second argument is a character, and this is to choose which mode to open in. There are 3 main modes for interacting with files; read, write and append. We want to append as any new data should go on to the end of the file. Append means ‘add at the end’, just like an appendix goes at the end of a book. We then make a csv writer, in this case one that specifically works with dictionaries. The CSV writer does things like adds commas and matches the fields to the dictionary keys. To be able to do this, it needs to know what file it is using, and also what fields it has. We then iterate over our new additions list and write each new item to our database file. The writer does all the finnicky parts, we just hand it a dictionary and it will create a row for us. "
