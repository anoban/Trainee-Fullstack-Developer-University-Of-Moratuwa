HALF A LEAGUE, HALF A LEAGUE,
HALF A LEAGUE ONWARD,
ALL IN THE VALLEY OF DEATH
RODE THE SIX HUNDRED.
"FORWARD, THE LIGHT BRIGADE!
CHARGE FOR THE GUNS!" HE SAID:
INTO THE VALLEY OF DEATH
RODE THE SIX HUNDRED.

"FORWARD, THE LIGHT BRIGADE!"
WAS THERE A MAN DISMAYÂ€™D?
NOT THOÂ€™ THE SOLDIER KNEW
SOME ONE HAD BLUNDERÂ€™D:
THEIRS NOT TO MAKE REPLY,
THEIRS NOT TO REASON WHY,
THEIRS BUT TO DO AND DIE:
INTO THE VALLEY OF DEATH
RODE THE SIX HUNDRED.

CANNON TO RIGHT OF THEM,
CANNON TO LEFT OF THEM,
CANNON IN FRONT OF THEM
VOLLEYÂ€™D AND THUNDERÂ€™D;
STORMÂ€™D AT WITH SHOT AND SHELL,
BOLDLY THEY RODE AND WELL,
INTO THE JAWS OF DEATH,
INTO THE MOUTH OF HELL
RODE THE SIX HUNDRED.

FLASHÂ€™D ALL THEIR SABRES BARE,
FLASHÂ€™D AS THEY TURNÂ€™D IN AIR
SABRING THE GUNNERS THERE,
CHARGING AN ARMY, WHILE
ALL THE WORLD WONDERÂ€™D:
PLUNGED IN THE BATTERY-SMOKE
RIGHT THROÂ€™ THE LINE THEY BROKE;
COSSACK AND RUSSIAN
REELÂ€™D FROM THE SABRE-STROKE
SHATTERÂ€™D AND SUNDERÂ€™D.
THEN THEY RODE BACK, BUT NOT
NOT THE SIX HUNDRED.

CANNON TO RIGHT OF THEM,
CANNON TO LEFT OF THEM,
CANNON BEHIND THEM
VOLLEYÂ€™D AND THUNDERÂ€™D;
STORMÂ€™D AT WITH SHOT AND SHELL,
WHILE HORSE AND HERO FELL,
THEY THAT HAD FOUGHT SO WELL
CAME THROÂ€™ THE JAWS OF DEATH,
BACK FROM THE MOUTH OF HELL,
ALL THAT WAS LEFT OF THEM,
LEFT OF SIX HUNDRED.

WHEN CAN THEIR GLORY FADE?
O THE WILD CHARGE THEY MADE!
ALL THE WORLD WONDERÂ€™D.
HONOR THE CHARGE THEY MADE!
HONOR THE LIGHT BRIGADE,
NOBLE SIX HUNDRED!
